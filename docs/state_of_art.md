## About

Hereafter I document articles that can be related to bicycle network design problem. The documents are stored in an unorganized, descriptive resource linked list.

## Network documents

### Multilayer networks

- Title: Multilayer networks
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnu016>

### Structure and dynamics of multilayer networks

- Title: The structure and dynamics of multilayer networks
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2014.07.001>

### Complexity and intractability of some problems in multilayer graph

- Title: Assessing the computational complexity of multilayer subgraph detection
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2019.13>

### Special issue on multilayer networks

- Title: Introduction to the special issue on multilayer networks
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2017.15>

### Multi-commodity multi-facility network design

- Title: Multi-commodity multi-facility network design
- URL: 

Studies the problem of supplying multiple commodities from source nodes to destination nodes in a network where multiple facilities can be added to enhance the arcs capacities and so be able to supply more commodities.

## Bicycle network design documents

### Bike network design problem with path-size logit-based equilibrium constraint

- Title: Bike network design problem with a path-size logit-based equilibrium constraint: Formulation, global optimization, and matheuristic
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2019.05.010>

### Optimization model for bicycle network design

- Title: A Mathematical Optimization Model For A Bicycle Network Design Considering Bicycle Level Of Service
- URL: <https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/14759>

It's like the base problem but considers the level of service as a numeric value which represents the level of improvement over the existing infrastructure. Instead of having a discrete amount of improvement layers, it has a single improvement value.

## Approximate models

### ML Surrogate Models for Linear Programs

- Title: ReLU Networks as Surrogate Models in Mixed-Integer Linear Programs
- URL: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03140>

### Surrogate model based method for constrained optimization

- Title: A surrogate-model-based method for constrained optimization
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2000-4891>

A surrogate model based method for constrained problems not necessarly linears.

### Surrogate Mathematical Programmin
