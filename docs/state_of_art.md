## About

Hereafter I document articles that can be related to bicycle network design problem. The documents are stored in an unorganized, descriptive resource linked list.

## Network documents

### Complexity and intractability of some problems in multilayer graph

- Title: Assessing the computational complexity of multilayer subgraph detection

## Bicycle network design documents

### Bike network design problem with path-size logit-based equilibrum constraint

- Title: Bike network design problem with a path-size logit-based equilibrium constraint: Formulation, global optimization, and matheuristic
- URL: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2019.05.010>

### Optimization model for bicycle network design

- Title: A Mathematical Optimization Model For A Bicycle Network Design Considering Bicycle Level Of Service
- URL: <https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/14759>

Notes: It's like the base problem but considers the level of service as a numeric value which represents the level of improvement over the existing infrastructure. Instead of having a discrete amount of improvement layers, it has a single improvement value.
