The Problem
===========

Starting off from the base bicycle network design probelm: decide where to build and not to build bicycle infrastructure given a network modeling of a city, a set of origin-destination pairs and constraints on budget and user costs.

To that, the posibility to decide between a range of infrastrucutes, with penalties on infrastructure change during a ride from an OD pair has been added. This additional complexity makes the solution to the prior problem unusable and raises the need to use more complex representations of the network, probably as a multylayer network; or a more complex modeling of the problem.
